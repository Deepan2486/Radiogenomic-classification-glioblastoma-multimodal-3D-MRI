## A note about the directory structure:
- [data](data) contains the MRI scan files and the classification labels. Some pre-trained models are also saved in [saved_models](data/saved_models)
- [code](code) contains all the source code files, arranged in folders. The explanations of the code files are in [code_readme](code/README.md)
- [models](models) contains .py files returning all the segmentation, MTL and classification models. The explanations are in [models_readme](models/README.md)
- [Latex](latex_report_files) contains the Latex project report directory. [report.tex](latex_report_files/report.tex) is the main build file.
