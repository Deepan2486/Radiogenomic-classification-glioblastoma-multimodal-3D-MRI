# Instructions for Results

The experimentation results are arranged approach-wise. There is a direct correspondence to the source code arrangements in the [code](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/) folder.

The result files are explained below:
* [Segmentation Results](segmentation_results.pdf): This has the IoU scores (classwise) of the tumour segmentation task done in [Unet_segmentation](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/Unet_segmentation/). For the predicted tumour images, run the script in the respective segmentation file. 
* [MTL Results](MTL_results.pdf): This cumulatively has all the results for the MTL approach, done in  [MTL](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/UNet_MTL/). Users should run the below files to get the results:
  * T1-weighted and Flair middle slice results are performed in [middle_slice_MTL.py](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/UNet_MTL/middle_slice_MTL.py)
  * 10-slice sampled MTL results are performed in [10_slice_MTL.py](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/UNet_MTL/10_slice_MTL.py). 
* [Projection Results](projection_results.pdf): This has the projection results as documented in [Volumetric_projections](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/volumetric_projections_classification/). The projections are taken as : Mean, Max and Standard Deviation. 
 * [axis_1_classifier_projections.py](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/volumetric_projections_classification/AXIS_1_classifier_projection_training_testing.py) and [axis_1_MTL_projections.py](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/volumetric_projections_classification/AXIS_1_MTL_projection_training_testing.py) gives the projection classification scores for classifier (EfficientNet) and MTL experiments respectively. 
 * [axis_2,3_projections.py](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/volumetric_projections_classification/AXIS_2,3_projection_training_testing.py) performs the SD projections along coronal and saggital axes (axis 2 and axis 3)
 * [partition_projections.py](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/volumetric_projections_classification/partitional_projection_training_testing.py) gives the partitional projections approach (dividing the slice stack into 3 clusters and then projecting individually to form a 3-slice-stack).
* [2D Cascaded model](2D_cascaded_results.pdf): This file shows the results of the 2D cropped-mask cascaded model (code file: [2D_cascaded](/code/2D_cropped_cascaded)). Models are run with EfficientNet and ResNet as documented in the file.
* [3D Cascaded model](3D_cascaded_results.pdf): This file shows the results of the 3D cropped-mask 5-slice cascaded model (code file: [3D_cascaded](/code/3D_cropped_cascaded)). Please note:
