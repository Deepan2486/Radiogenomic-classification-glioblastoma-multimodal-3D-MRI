# Instructions for Results

The experimentation results are arranged approach-wise. There is a direct correspondence to the source code arrangements in the [code](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/) folder.

The result files are explained below:
* [Segmentation Results](segmentation_results.pdf): This has the IoU scores (classwise) of the tumour segmentation task done in [Unet_segmentation](https://github.com/Deepan2486/Radiogenomic-classification-glioblastoma-multimodal-3D-MRI/tree/main/code/Unet_segmentation/).
