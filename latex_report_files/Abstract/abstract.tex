O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status is an important genetic characteristic of glioblastoma and is crucial for it's diagnosis and chemotherapy efficacy. Multimodal MRI imaging techniques can contribute towards monitored automation of invasive surgical approaches. In this body of work, we propose an end-to-end pipeline of tumour segmentation and subsequent radiogenomic classification to classify the given MRI scans into being methylated or non-methylated. We develop a novel Multitask-learning based model (adapted from U-Net) to simultaneously perform segmentation and classification. Further, we utilise the segmentation results to cascade lightweight classification models based on several MRI slice sampling techniques to output the final classification scores. Our resultant pipeline performs well on each of the MRI axes, and several ensembles are tried out to arrive at suitable improvements. Based on 5-fold-cross-validation, we are able to surpass the current Kaggle leaderboard AUCs of the past BraTS RSNA-MICCAI Brain tumour challenge of 2021.
