# Instructions for the LaTeX folder structure

- ```report.tex``` is the main Latex files that runs to produce the final pdf. 
- Other folders like ```Abstract```, ```Introduction```, ```Methodology``` control the chapters in the report. When changes are made in them, they are automatically loaded in the main latex report file.
- Each folder also has a image directory, which stores all the images used in that chapter. 
- ```References/references.bib``` contains the References and Citation sources
- The styles are included in ```Classes/``` folder
