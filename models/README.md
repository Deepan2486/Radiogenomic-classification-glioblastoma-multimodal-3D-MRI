# Instructions for using Models

- Most of the models here are already pre-loaded in the .py files which use those models. However, this gives a compact representation of all the models use, so that future work can be directly extended.
- The python files here have functions in which the models are defined and/or compiled. When using the models, import the respective file into the current working file and then use the particular function for that particular model. 
- The models include

  - *Unet model
  - *Multi-task-Learning (MTL) model
  - *EfficientNet B0
  - *EfficientNet B3
  - *EfficientNet B5
  - *EfficientNet B7
  - *ResNet34
  - *ResNet18
